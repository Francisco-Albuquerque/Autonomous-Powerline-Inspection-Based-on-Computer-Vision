# Autonomous-Powerline-Inspection-Based-on-Computer-Vision
As the cornerstone of my Master's thesis in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I developed an AI Powerline Inspection Model. It uses Faster-RCNN and YOLOv5 for efficient power grid inspections. This reduces inspection time by pinpointing crucial components, improving accuracy and cost-effectiveness.
